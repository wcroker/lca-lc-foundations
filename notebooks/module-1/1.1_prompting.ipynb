      "- Location: Nestled in Shackleton Crater at the Moon’s southern polar region. The city hugs the inner rim and rides a network of geothermal vents, fed by solar collectors and photonic skylights that flood the streets with daylight even in the long polar night.\n",
      "- Government: The Lunar Concord — a technocratic federation of crater districts, orbital habitats, and surface settlements. Lunaris Prime houses the Grand Seal and serves as the seat of the Prime Overseer, who chairs the High Council and the Assembly of Craters.\n",
      "- Landmarks:\n",
      "  - The Helios Dome: a gigantic, partly rotating glass structure that funnels sunlight into the city core.\n",
      "  - The Lumen Gate: a colossal arch that channels energy and signals from Earth and beyond, acting as both gateway and museum.\n",
      "  - Archive of Silica: a vast memory repository stored in quartz and living AI archivists.\n",
      "  - Crescent Market: a bustling, under-d Dome where ice-mining families, biotech artisans, and scholars trade in rare resources and ideas.\n",
      "- Daily life: Gravity is gentle yet unstable in some transit corridors, so fields and rails keep citizens and visitors steady. Most food is grown in subterranean farms; homes are modular, with air-purifying domes and suit-free zones in the public sectors.\n",
      "- Culture: A fusion of ice-mining heritage, orbital diplomacy, and luminous art. Night festivals glow with bioluminescent flora and holographic constellations projected across the street-level plazas. The Crimson Lanterns mark the shift between work cycles and celebrations.\n",
      "- Flavor blurb: Lunaris Prime is where Earth-born politicians debate policy under a daylight dome while poets recite verses to a starfield carved in glass. It’s a city that literally shines with governance— and with the stubborn, hopeful glow of its people.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like, I can tailor Lunaris Prime to a different vibe (gritty frontier capital, pristine bureaucratic capital, or a mystical, cathedral-like lunar city) or name another capital for a variant of the Moon’s world.\n"
